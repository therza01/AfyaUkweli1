# üéØ Supervisor-Controlled Attendance System - Complete Guide

## ‚úÖ System Overview

The system is now configured so that **supervisors control all CHW sign-ins and sign-outs**. CHWs can also self-check-in using QR codes, but the supervisor has full control to manually manage their team.

---

## üîë How It Works

### Daily Workflow

**1. Supervisor Morning Setup**:
- Login to supervisor account
- Navigate to "Attendance" page from sidebar
- Click "Generate QR Code" button
- QR code displays on screen (valid for today only)

**2. Sign CHWs In (Two Methods)**:

**Method A: Supervisor Manual Sign-In** ‚≠ê **RECOMMENDED**
- Supervisor selects CHW name from dropdown
- Clicks "Sign In CHW" button
- CHW is immediately signed in and starts earning points

**Method B: CHW Self Check-In** (Optional)
- CHW scrolls to bottom of their dashboard
- Clicks "Open QR Scanner"
- Selects supervisor from dropdown
- Enters QR code shown by supervisor
- Clicks "Check In"

**3. During Workday**:
- CHWs complete their tasks normally
- Supervisor can view who's currently working
- Real-time status updates on attendance page

**4. End of Day - Sign Out**:
- Supervisor clicks "Sign Out" button next to CHW's name
- System automatically calculates:
  - Hours worked = Check-out time - Check-in time
  - Points earned = Hours worked √ó 10
- Points immediately added to CHW's balance

**5. Monthly Payment**:
- Admin reviews total points per CHW
- Points = Money earned
- Example: 200 points = $1,000 (if rate is $5/point)

## üí∞ Points System

### How Points Are Earned

**Rate**: 10 points per hour worked
**Calculation**: Automatic when supervisor signs CHW out
**Display**: Both task points and attendance points combined

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Full Day**
- Sign in: 8:00 AM
- Sign out: 5:00 PM (9 hours)
- Points earned: 90 points

**Scenario 2: Half Day**
- Sign in: 9:00 AM
- Sign out: 1:00 PM (4 hours)
- Points earned: 40 points

**Scenario 3: Overtime**
- Sign in: 7:00 AM
- Sign out: 7:00 PM (12 hours)
- Points earned: 120 points

### Total Balance

CHW points balance shows:
- **Task points**: Approved tasks (10-15 points each)
- **Attendance points**: Hours worked (10 points/hour)
- **Total**: Sum of both

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "CHW already checked in today"
**Problem**: Trying to sign in CHW who's already signed in
**Solution**: Check if they're in the "Working Now" list, sign them out first

### "Invalid QR code or expired"
**Problem**: QR code not working
**Solution**:
- Generate new QR code (button on supervisor page)
- Ensure using today's code, not yesterday's
- Check supervisor ID matches

### "No active check-in found"
**Problem**: Cannot sign out CHW
**Solution**:
- Verify CHW was signed in today
- Check you're the supervisor who signed them in
- Review attendance list for their status

### Points not showing
**Problem**: CHW doesn't see attendance points
**Solution**:
- Sign out must be completed (not just signed in)
- Refresh the points balance card
- Check attendance status page

### Cannot select CHW from dropdown
**Problem**: Dropdown empty or CHW missing
**Solution**:
- CHW already signed in (check working list)
- CHW doesn't exist in system
- CHW assigned to different supervisor

```
