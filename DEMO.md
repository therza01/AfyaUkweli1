## Demo Talking Points

### Problem Statement
"Community health programs struggle to track and incentivize CHW activities. Traditional systems lack transparency, have high administrative costs, and make it difficult to verify work completion."

### Solution
"AfyaUkweli uses Hedera Hashgraph to create an immutable audit trail and automatic reward system. Every task is logged on HCS, and approved tasks trigger instant token transfers via HTS."

### Why Hedera?
- **Fixed Low Fees**: $0.0001 per log, $0.001 per transfer
- **Speed**: 3-5 second finality
- **Sustainability**: At 1000 tasks/day, costs ~$3/month
- **Carbon Negative**: Environmentally responsible
- **Comparison**: Ethereum would cost $5-50 per transaction (unusable)

### Impact
- **For CHWs**: Transparent rewards, instant verification
- **For Supervisors**: Easy approval workflow with full context
- **For Programs**: Real-time visibility, audit compliance, cost savings
- **For Communities**: Better health outcomes through incentivized care

## Optional: Advanced Features

If time permits, highlight:

1. **Privacy Design**:
   - No PII on-chain
   - Consent codes are SHA-256 hashed
   - Location stored as geohash (100m precision)

2. **Offline Support**:
   - CHW UI queues tasks locally
   - Auto-syncs when connectivity returns

3. **Security**:
   - Row-Level Security (RLS) on database
   - Role-based access control
   - JWT authentication

4. **Scalability**:
   - Supabase (PostgreSQL) handles millions of rows
   - Hedera supports 10,000+ TPS
   - Next.js scales horizontally

## Test Accounts Summary

| Role       | Email                    | Password |
|------------|--------------------------|----------|
| CHW        | akinyi.otieno@afya.ke    | demo123  |
| Supervisor | mary.wekesa@afya.ke      | demo123  |
| Admin      | admin@afya.ke            | demo123  |

## Troubleshooting

**Q: HashScan links show "not found"**
A: If using mock mode (no real Hedera setup), the transaction hashes are simulated. For live demo, run `npm run setup:hedera` first.

**Q: No tasks in supervisor view**
A: Ensure database is seeded with `npm run db:seed`. Check status filter (PENDING vs ALL).

**Q: Charts not loading**
A: Refresh page. Ensure `/api/stats` endpoint returns data (check browser DevTools ‚Üí Network tab).

## Closing Statement

"AfyaUkweli demonstrates how blockchain technology‚Äîspecifically Hedera‚Äîcan solve real-world problems in healthcare logistics. By combining immutable logging with automatic incentives, we create a transparent, efficient system that benefits everyone: CHWs get fair compensation, supervisors streamline workflows, and programs gain unprecedented visibility. All while keeping costs predictable and low."
